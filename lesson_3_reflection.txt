When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    when you’re collaborating with team members.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   Because some changes may not be necessary you are the better judge than a program.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

   forks are clones that are on the GitHub website. Branches are segments from the same repository that are used to separate the project so there can be multiple versions and clones are duplicates on the local level either taken remotely or duplicated locally.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    for comparisons and/or merges

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    everything, i would fee safer and I wouldn’t have to send emails or anything. I wouldn’t have to keep files. This is just much easier.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

   i would rather make a change in a branch when I’m trying to create a new feature. the benefits is being able to work on multiple things at once without having to conflict with another.
